1st steps:

Past : bac + spés + localisation
Bac: Math + physics/Chemistry + math expert AND eurosection English in Strasbourg
Prépa: PCSI/PSI near Versailles


Present: SN, N7
I came to N7, in SN, where I followed the general 1A course, that's where I grew an intrest in how devices communicate, and how the global network works. Combined to Mark ... the youtuber that tracks scammers' devices and has worked with the Indian gov to stop them thanks to his hacking skills
That led to an intrest in white hats and how to defend/detect from attacks
That is why I chose Local Networks as my 2A speciality


Future: Stage 2A + spé/UE choix 3A + stage 3A + autres projets
Stage 2A: Systems or local networks Safran/Capgemini (Germany or UK)
3A: try to get TLS-SEC w/ TryHackMe website. or at least the cybersec Educational Unit

Pro plan: what job?, where, job market, possible evolution
what? Cybersecurity

where? SouthWest of Paris

Job Market :
	high presence of Safran, and Plateau de Saclay : MANY tech companies: Orange, Free, Bouyges, Banks, Thales, Capgemini, Atos ect...
	Cybersecurity is, with AI, one of the highest grossing IT sectors in terms of employment.
	salaries range from 40-50k for juniors and can quickly increase as we gain important practical skills ontop of the already aquired knowledge.
	Safran: System engineers : 45-47k, and cybersec even more (source: mom)

possible evolutions:
Cybersec and security more generally very often, due to it's importance, are found at many different areas of the hierarchy, allowing for a very vertical growth
And as an engineer, it allows for vertical growth
