In the wake of the liberation of speech surrounding diversity, inclusion as well as hazing in engineering schools, the whole class of 2026 had to watch an interactive play “Le Procès de King Kong” that tacles these issues. The play, cut in three parts followed by group discussions on what we felt was wrong on each of these parts, ranging from clearly illegal acts to more blurred and subtle ones.
	
	Each part showed different acts, and each time, there was a large majority of the students who agreed on problematic actions, but no consensus which led to constructive debates and sensibilisation of acts that can be commonplace but hide discrimination and violence. These debates were also a time for those that suffered such violences to share their experience. This issue is especially true as it also tackled sexism and sexual based violences and agressions, a problem discovered in engineering schools in 2020-2021. It especially raised concerns about the lack of reports on the matter, such as sexual agressions and harassment that were not reported, whether it is to the student or administrative bodies. These new lights depicted events and situations to be wary of, and gave us some ideas on how to act in such situations and after, as victims or as witnesses. 

	The fat that this play was organized by the school for the new students shows the need to raise awareness about this matter that is more widespread than people think. Because if we ask people if they are sexist, it is likely that all or close to all answers will be no. However, a vast majority of women were victim of sexist agressions or statements. This shows that this phenomenon can be partly explained by the fact that anyone can, withou knowing it say something that is sexist, even sex equality advocats.
