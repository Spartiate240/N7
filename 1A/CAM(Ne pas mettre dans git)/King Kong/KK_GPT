Title: "Le Procès de King Kong" - A Theatrical Exploration of Diversity, Inclusion, and Harassment in Engineering Schools

In response to the newfound freedom of expression surrounding diversity, inclusion, and hazing in engineering schools, the entire class of 2026 was compelled to experience an eye-opening interactive play titled "Le Procès de King Kong." This theatrical production, divided into three parts, aimed to address these pressing issues, sparking crucial conversations among students.

Following each segment, the audience engaged in group discussions, dissecting a spectrum of behaviors from clearly illegal acts to nuanced and subtle forms of discrimination. Although a majority of students recognized the problematic nature of certain actions, the absence of a unanimous consensus fueled constructive debates. These discussions sensitized attendees to acts that might be commonplace yet conceal discrimination and violence. Additionally, these sessions provided a platform for survivors to courageously share their experiences.

The play did not shy away from addressing the prevalent issues of sexism and sexual violence within engineering schools, a concern that surfaced prominently in 2020-2021. It raised alarm about the underreporting of sexual aggressions and harassment, shedding light on a troubling reality where such incidents often go unreported to both fellow students and administrative bodies. The revelations illuminated events and situations that demanded vigilance, offering insights on how to respond as victims or witnesses.

The fact that the school organized this play for new students underscores a dire need to raise awareness about these pervasive issues. The paradox revealed by the play is striking—while most individuals may deny harboring sexist attitudes, a significant number of women have been victims of sexist aggressions or statements. This disjunction underscores the insidious nature of sexism, emphasizing that even those advocating for gender equality may unwittingly perpetuate sexist behavior.

In essence, "Le Procès de King Kong" transcends the boundaries of traditional theatre; it serves as a potent tool for raising awareness and fostering dialogue on the widespread issues of discrimination, harassment, and violence within the academic realm. By confronting these challenges head-on, the play empowers students with the knowledge and empathy needed to contribute to a more inclusive and respectful educational environment.
