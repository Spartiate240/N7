After months of hearing numerous times about the Climate Fresk and it’s benefits, on the 15th of September 2023, I finally participated in the Climate Fresk activity with fellow students from the ENSEEIHT class of 2026.

Despite already having some knowledge about how the climate is impacted by human activities, and in turn how those changes impact the environment. It provided us with more precision and as well as numbers, even including more marginal effects and causes all the while being supervised by trained personnel. 

Furthermore, as future engineers, it is our job to be aware of the impact our inventions  and actions can have, and thus the need to take into account the environmental impact of our actions. Even going as far as researching ways to protect the environment rather than limiting it’s destruction or pushing for eco-friendly alternatives to current methods or products that destroy the environment.
But we are not only future engineers, we are also humans, and with that, our daily activities outside of our work can impact the Climate. And so encourages us to change our habits to reduce our carbon dioxyde emissions and our consumption of other ressources. For example, having more efficient heating or cooling systems, better isolation or less water consumption with newer shower knobs or with dish washers. These are also valid with electricity. 
	As a group, I realized that almost all of those that participated are in a similar situation where we know about the issue. This is a good feeling as it showed that it is known and taken seriously at least by the younger generations, which will in turn reflect in their life choices like which jobs and companies they will want to join, and those that they will avoid.
